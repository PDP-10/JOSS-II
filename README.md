# JOSS (Supervisor?) for DEC 36-bit machines

This is slowly being copied from RAND Corporation's source listing of JOSS for the PDP-6.

The URL is: https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5437.html

***CAUTION***:This has obviously been untested, incomplete, and is in no functional state at the moment.

The current goal is to archive the source from a listing for the supervisor in both an easy to read format for both humans and machines.  The ultimate goal is try to get a running system on either aap's or Richard Cornwell's PDP-6 simulators but that may prove difficult at the moment.  We're possibly missing the JOSS intrepreter.

Feel free to drop any clues, hints, or whatever in the issue tracker if you have anything that can help us.
