# JOSS (Supervisor?) for DEC 36-bit machines

This is slowly being copied from RAND Corporation's source listing of JOSS for the PDP-6.

The URL is: https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5437.html

The current file naming scheme is su.mac.foo where foo is the page I stopped working on.  The numbers are vestiages of working on a system without versions.

***CAUTION***:This has obviously been untested, incomplete, and is in no functional state at the moment.
