# JOSS-II Supervisor for DEC 36-bit machines

This is slowly being copied from RAND Corporation's [source listing of JOSS Supervisor for the PDP-6](https://pdp-10.github.io/JOSS-II/docs/RM-5437-PR_JOSS_Assembly_Listing_of_the_Supervisor.pdf) ([RAND original](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5437.html)).

There is [additional documentation](https://pdp-10.github.io/JOSS-II/docs/) available too.

***CAUTION***: This has obviously been untested, incomplete, and is in no functional state at the moment.

The ultimate goal is try to get a running system on either aap's or Richard Cornwell's PDP-6 simulators but that may prove difficult at the moment.  We're possibly missing the JOSS interpreter.

Feel free to drop any clues, hints, or whatever in the issue tracker at the repo in the PDP-10 organization if you have anything that can help us.

**STATUS UPDATE:**  The supervisor has long since been finished.  We have AID, DECâ€™s name for JOSS-II, from Tymshare, Monitor 5.03, and the the final version from 1979.    The general goal is now to analyze and rebuild what we can from what resources we have available to us.
